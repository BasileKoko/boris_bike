# Boris Bike Challenge
Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of new bike
system, come to us with a plan : a network of docking stations and
bikes that anyone can use. They want us to build a program that will
emulate all the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure (repair
staff, and so on) to make this project a reality.
